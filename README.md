## Tools
Welcome to my data analysis project, in which I leveraged an array of tools including Advanced Excel, PowerBI, SQL, and Tableau. Through these tools, I extracted valuable insights from employee data and crafted a comprehensive dashboard to conduct in-depth analysis on employee retention.

The project entailed handling extensive datasets from HR records, requiring the utilization of a diverse set of tools for data extraction, transformation, and loading. I harnessed advanced Excel functionalities like data validation, conditional formatting, and pivot tables to cleanse and organize the data. Additionally, I employed SQL to merge multiple tables and extract the necessary data for analysis.

Once the data had been structured and purified, I employed Tableau to construct various visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps. These visualizations shed light on the correlations among various employee attributes, such as age, gender, department, and job role, enabling me to uncover critical trends and patterns crucial for employee retention.

Subsequently, I harnessed Power BI to create an all-encompassing dashboard that incorporated the insights derived from the analysis. The dashboard encompassed a wide range of metrics, including statistics on average monthly income, attrition rate, work-life balance, years since the last promotion, and working hours categorized by department and job role. This dashboard facilitated HR managers in swiftly and effortlessly monitoring and analyzing employee retention data, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Overall, this project offered a remarkable platform for me to showcase my proficiency as a data analyst, making effective use of an assortment of tools to extract insights from intricate datasets. I am enthusiastic about continuing to explore these tools and techniques while contributing to the data analysis community.
